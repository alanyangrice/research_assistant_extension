Current:
1. Change the functionality of the text summarize/explanation
        a. If there is more text highlighted, probably wants a summary of it.
            Want to make it in context of the sources it cites, so need to be able to cite
            the sources in our summarizing generator
        b. If there is a single word, probably wants a definition of the term or word
        c. If there is a sentence or more than a few words, probably want an explanation
            of the idea in the context of the paper
2. To achieve 1a. I need to be able to scrape the website for the sources quickly and be
    able to determine what sources were mentioned in a section
3. Fix the styling of the sidebar
4. Be able to click a button to tell GPT to generate a simpler or more complex response.
        a. Be able to start a sidechat with GPT to discuss and ask followup questions

Future:
1. Be able to use it on PDFs
2. Add some highlighting feature so if you click on the highlight, it can bring you back
    to the previously explained block
3. Let the user be able to customize the explanation styles
4. AI-Powered question answering, let the user ask follow-up questions based on highlighted
    text
5. Maybe export notes to a google doc?
6. Maybe allow the user to type in notes they want to take about the paper they are reading
    and make use of point 5?
7. For more specific domains like ML or math, maybe be able to select an image of text to add
    to the explanation so the user can capture complex formulas to be explained
